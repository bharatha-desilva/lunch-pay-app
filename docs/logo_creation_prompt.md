**Prompt:**
You are an expert UI/UX engineer and creative brand designer. I am providing you with a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for our hackathon project. Based on this SRS, generate a modern and innovative **logo** for the project.

**Project context (from the attached file):**

* Project Name: **LunchPay**
* It is an expense-splitting web app inspired by Splitwise.
* Key themes: fairness, trust, collaboration, expense sharing, and group connections.
* The logo must feel **sleek, minimal, and technology-driven**, while still friendly.

**Design requirements:**

* Include balance/money + group/connection theme.
* Use **vibrant but professional colors** (teal, green, and subtle gradients).
* The design should be clean, vector-style, and scalable for presentations, web app headers, and hackathon branding.
* Typography should be modern and readable.
* Final output: a polished digital vector-style logo.

Would you like me to also refine this into a **multi-step “chain-of-thought style” prompt** (first analyzing the SRS, then generating variations, then polishing one), so you can reuse it in different AI tools for consistent results?
