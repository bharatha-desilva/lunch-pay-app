## 8. Dependencies & Risks

### 8.1 Technical Dependencies

#### **Critical Path Dependencies**
1. **Bootstrap Phase Completion**: All parallel work depends on Developer 1 completing foundation
2. **API Service Layer**: Both developers depend on generic API service implementation
3. **Authentication Context**: Group and expense features depend on auth implementation
4. **Component Structure**: Advanced features depend on basic component implementation

#### **Library Dependencies**
- React Query for state management (affects all API integration)
- React Hook Form for form handling (affects all form components)
- shadcn/ui for UI components (affects all visual components)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (affects all visual design)

### 8.2 Team Dependencies

#### **Developer 1 → Developer 2**
- API service layer must be complete before integration
- Authentication context needed for protected features
- Type definitions required for TypeScript compilation

#### **Both Developers → Tester**
- Features must be implemented before testing
- Deployment environment needed for final validation
- Bug fixes may require developer attention

#### **External Dependencies**
- Generic API backend availability
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Hosting platform for deployment
- Third-party libraries and CDNs

### 8.3 Risk Mitigation

#### **High-Risk Scenarios**

**Risk 1: Bootstrap Phase Overrun**
- **Impact**: Delays parallel development start
- **Mitigation**: Strict timeboxing, pre-planned structure, fallback simplified setup
- **Contingency**: Developer 2 assists with bootstrap if needed

**Risk 2: API Integration Issues**
- **Impact**: Core functionality blocked
- **Mitigation**: Mock API implementation, early API testing, error handling
- **Contingency**: Client-side data storage as temporary solution

**Risk 3: Complex Feature Implementation Delays**
- **Impact**: Missing MVP features
- **Mitigation**: Feature prioritization, simplified implementations, time buffers
- **Contingency**: Remove advanced features, focus on core functionality

**Risk 4: Testing Bottleneck**
- **Impact**: Unvalidated deployment
- **Mitigation**: Continuous testing, automated checks, parallel validation
- **Contingency**: Focus on critical path testing, document known issues

#### **Medium-Risk Scenarios**

**Risk 5: UI/UX Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Use proven component library, focus on functionality over aesthetics
- **Contingency**: Simplified UI design, remove animations and polish features

**Risk 6: State Management Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Use established patterns, React Query for server state
- **Contingency**: Simplified state management, direct API calls

**Risk 7: Performance Issues**
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing throughout development, optimization checkpoints
- **Contingency**: Remove performance-heavy features, optimize critical paths

#### **Contingency Plans**

**If Bootstrap Overruns (>1:00)**
- Developer 2 assists with remaining setup
- Reduce scope of advanced features
- Focus on core authentication and expense creation

**If Core Features Behind Schedule (>2:30)**
- Remove settlement system from MVP
- Simplify to equal splitting only
- Focus on basic expense tracking

**If Final Integration Issues (>3:30)**
- Manual deployment if CI/CD fails
- Document known issues for post-hackathon
- Focus on core demo functionality
