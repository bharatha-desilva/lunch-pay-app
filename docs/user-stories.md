## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers and Solutions

**Risk 1: Complex Balance Calculations**
- *Mitigation*: Start with simple equal splits, add complexity incrementally
- *Fallback*: Manual calculation verification, simplified debt tracking

**Risk 2: Real-time Data Synchronization**
- *Mitigation*: Use simple polling or page refresh initially
- *Fallback*: Manual refresh options, batch updates

**Risk 3: User Authentication Integration**
- *Mitigation*: Use established libraries (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
- *Fallback*: Simple session-based authentication

**Risk 4: Time Overruns on Core Features**
- *Mitigation*: Strict timeboxing, feature prioritization
- *Fallback*: Remove non-essential features, focus on core functionality

### Testing Strategy for Each Iteration

**Iteration 1 Testing**:
- Unit tests for authentication
- Integration tests for group creation
- Manual testing of user flows

**Iteration 2 Testing**:
- Balance calculation verification
- Expense creation edge cases
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Iteration 3 Testing**:
- Complex splitting scenarios
- Settlement workflow validation
- Data consistency checks

**Iteration 4 Testing**:
- End-to-end user journeys
- Performance testing
- Deployment verification
