## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the LunchPay application, an expense-splitting web application inspired by Splitwise. The document serves as the primary reference for the development team during the 4-hour hackathon and defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

The SRS is designed to enable AI-assisted code generation using Cursor AI and provides detailed technical specifications for React-based frontend development with TypeScript integration.

### 1.2 Scope

- Settle debts and maintain expense history
- Categorize expenses for better organization

**In Scope for MVP**:
- User authentication and registration
- Group creation and management
- Basic and advanced expense splitting
- Balance calculation and debt tracking
- Expense categorization and history
- Debt settlement functionality

**Out of Scope for MVP**:
- Mobile applications
- Real-time notifications via email/SMS
- Complex reporting and analytics
- Third-party payment integration
- Multi-currency support
